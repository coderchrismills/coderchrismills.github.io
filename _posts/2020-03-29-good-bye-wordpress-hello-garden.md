# Good bye Wordpress. Hello Garden.

Well, I'm done with Wordpress and have gone back to wanting the simplicity of a static site. The impetus this time for getting back to blogging is to track the development of my garden and my app [Lazy Gardener](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lazy-gardener/id1183003518) this growing season. 

The first bed to get started this year has starts of spinach, chard and peas.

Other bed has seeds germinating for kale, salad greens, radicchio and arugula.Planted them last week so was surprised to see that almost everything in that bed is sprouting. Look at that little salad sprout go.

Still have four beds from last year to prep and one new bed to get setup. Next thing we (my partner and I) have set to plant is potatoes.
