# Making a Nova Extension

In a [previous post](https://coderchrismills.com/articles/finding-my-markdown-workflow/) one of the reasons I didn't continue with Sublime as my note taking app of choice was because I would have to learn how to make a build system. Well, I chose instead to go with Nova and just finished uploading my [first extension](https://github.com/coderchrismills/NovaExtensions/tree/main/Todo-txt/todo.txt.novaextension), a todo.txt syntax highlighter. The irony is not lost on me. Guess if I end up back using Sublime, "making an extension" can't really be an excuse to not doing something. Especially when the tool does everything else I need ðŸ¤”.
