# Some quick life drawing

Decided to hop on [QuickPoses.com](https://quickposes.com) and do some quick life drawing exercises. Specifically went with 20 images total each changing every 60 seconds. Did a set of 10 animals too, and thought the birds came out pretty good. Given I haven't done this type of stuff in almost a year I'm pretty happy with the result. 

Done on my iPad 12.9" with an Apple Pencil using Procreate. Technical Pen brush, default settings.
