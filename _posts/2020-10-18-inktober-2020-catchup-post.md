# Inktober 2020 - Catching Up

Been having a blast doing Inktober this year. After work it's been a great way to chill, zone out, and forget about work. I'm still a bit behind on some prompts, but we'll get there. Noticed that "Tooth" was missing in the compilation, but it was more terrible than "Bulky", so probably for the best. Just a little halfway through the month so thereâ€™s still time to jump in and start drawing if you haven't.

All done in my Moleskin notebook with a Muji pen.
