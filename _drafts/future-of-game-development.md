With all the layoffs last year and their continuation this year I keep thinking we're seeing the start of the "meme-ification" of games. When I say "meme-ification" I don't mean that all games will be trivial easy make, but that the gradient of games between between single person shops and AAA will be fast.

On one end of the spectrum will be "meme" games. These games will be developed using AI tools in near realtime. I imagine in my lifetime that kids will be able to talk to their headsets and riff on a silly game idea and see it come to life. The headsets will all be seeing the same thing and the experience will be shared. Much like when I was a kid we had to use our imagination to "see" the same made up work, kids soon will be able to speak and conjure these worlds.

On the other end your CODs and God of War's will exist. These will still require millions if not billions of dollars to develop. With high development cost the margins will only allow for a few of these to be made. While this is somewhat true now, the number of these games will decrease over time and in turn the number of large studios working on these games will also decrease. AI will also be used at these studios as no one can deny the productivity increases they provide.

What will be lost will be the current AA games. Games like Call of Cthulu or Sifu. These games relatively high quality games and fill a creative niche. I would argue that their creativity and departure from what tends to be either the safe bets or relying on visual quality bar of a AAA game is what sets them apart, for now. The reason this segment will be in trouble is that the creative niche games will be rapid fire in the future, and the games will be trained and tailored to the people playing them. It will be hard to compete on creativity and impossible to compete on budget.

As someone who currently makes their living as a game developer the future I've described is one that unless I'm working for a AAA company, I don't see how I would be able to pay my bills. Much like memes, people will be making games for free in their spare time. They'll be doing it for fun, but not for profit. Speed, creativity, and first to market will be what matters, not quality. As a friend of mine said when we were discussing this topic, "Getting someone to pay for your game will be like getting them to pay for poetry". I still believe AAA will command a good salary, possibly not work-life balance, but a good salary. Their will still be a need for highly skilled developers. The number of people who have the skills to meet what will be an incredibly hight bar will be few. Overall I think the number of people needed to make games will stay similar to what it is now. In the end studio who have the large budgets will not be risking it on people the don't trust can deliver.

All is not lost. The future for games and the creative explosion that will happen over the next decade is going to be exciting. At some point AR will be everywhere, same with AI. How we interact with games will be personal, sharable, highly interactive, and immensely creative. Looking at how far things like Sora have come over the past year
